        <p>Do you like Cheese Whiz? Spray tan? Fake eyelashes? That's what is Lorem Ipsum to many—it rubs them the wrong
            way, all the way. It's unreal, uncanny, makes you wonder if something is wrong, it seems to seek your
            attention for all the wrong reasons. Usually, we prefer the real thing, wine without sulfur based
            preservatives, real butter, not margarine, and so we'd like our layouts and designs to be filled with real
            words, with thoughts that count, information that has value. </p>
        </p>

        <p>The toppings you may chose for that TV dinner pizza slice when you forgot to shop for foods, the paint you
            may slap on your face to impress the new boss is your business. But what about your daily bread? Design
            comps, layouts, wireframes—will your clients accept that you go about things the facile way? Authorities in
            our business will tell in no uncertain terms that Lorem Ipsum is that huge, huge no no to forswear forever.
            Not so fast, I'd say, there are some redeeming factors in favor of greeking text, as its use is merely the
            symptom of a worse problem to take into consideration.</p>

        <p>You begin with a text, you sculpt information, you chisel away what's not needed, you come to the point, make
            things clear, add value, you're a content person, you like words. Design is no afterthought, far from it,
            but it comes in a deserved second. Anyway, you still use Lorem Ipsum and rightly so, as it will always have
            a place in the web workers toolbox, as things happen, not always the way you like it, not always in the
            preferred order. Even if your less into design and more into content strategy you may find some redeeming
            value with, wait for it, dummy copy, no less.</p>
